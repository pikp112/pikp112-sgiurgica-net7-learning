	Sorting algorithm:
	-I have 10 day task and they have to be sorted:
		9 1 5 7 6 2	3 4 10 8 => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

	 4. Pseudocode:
		4.1 The value of the tax taken by an ATM for a withdraw operation:
	
	START
	WHILE someone wants to withdraw money
		INPUT amount withdrawn
		FOR amount calculate a tax value 0.5% of the amount
			IF tax value less than 1$
				tax value is 1$
			ENDIF
		ENDFOR
	ENDWHILE
	
		//Code:
	withdrawOperation=true;
	while(withdrawOperation){
		int amount=Console.ReadLine();//amount withdrawn
		int tax=0.5/100*amount;
		if(tax<1){
			tax=1;
		}
	}

		4.2 Algorithm that calculates how many banknotes your ATM has to charge for the amount entered:
	
	START
	INPUT amount entered
	FOR each entered amount calculates
		dividing by 500 AND the rest of the division
		dividing the rest by 200 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 100 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 50 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 20 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 10 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 5 AND the rest
		dividing the rest by 1 AND the rest
	ENDFOR
		

	//code
	bool withdrawOperation=true;
	if(withdrawOperation){
		int amount=(Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()));//amount withdrawn
		int rest=0;
		if(amount/500!=0){
			rest=amount%500;
			Console.WriteLine(rest+"x500");
		}
		if(amount/200!=0){
			rest=amount/200;
			Console.WriteLine(rest+"x200");
		}
		if(amount/100!=0){
			rest=amount/100;
			Console.WriteLine(rest+"x100");
		}
		if(amount/0!=0){
			rest=amount/100;
			Console.WriteLine(rest+" x100");
		}
	}

		amount/500=a;
		amount/200=b;
		amount/100=c;

	Sorting algorithm:
	-I have 10 day task and they have to be sorted:
		9 1 5 7 6 2	3 4 10 8 => 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10.

	 4. Pseudocode:
		4.1 The value of the tax taken by an ATM for a withdraw operation:
	
	START
	WHILE someone wants to withdraw money
		INPUT amount withdrawn
		FOR amount calculate a tax value 0.5% of the amount and SET it
			IF tax value less than 1$
				tax value is 1$
			ENDIF
			PRINT tax value
		ENDFOR
	ENDWHILE
	
		//Code:
	withdrawOperation=true;
	while(withdrawOperation){
		int amount=Console.ReadLine();//amount withdrawn
		int tax=0.5/100*amount;
		if(tax<1){
			tax=1;
		}
	}

		4.2 Algorithm that calculates how many banknotes your ATM has to charge for the amount entered:
	
	START
	FOREACH entered amount calculates
	INPUT amount entered
		dividing by 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1 AND the rest of the division
			SET how many times the amount AND the rest is divided by 500, 100, 50, 20 , 5 or 1
			PRINT the number of divisions
	ENDFOREACH
		

	//code
	bool withdrawOperation=true;
	while(withdrawOperation){
		int amount=(Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()));//amount withdrawn
		if(amount!=0){
		if(amount>=500){
			int banknoteOf500=amount/500;
			Console.Write("{0}x500",banknoteOf500)};
			amount=amount-(500*banknoteOf500);
		}
		if(amount>=200){
			int banknoteOf200=amount/200;
			Console.Write(" {0}x200",banknoteOf200)};
			amount=amount-(200*banknoteOf200);
		}
		if(amount>=100){
			int banknoteOf100=amount/100;
			Console.Write(" {0}x100",banknoteOf100)};
			amount=amount-(100*banknoteOf100);
		}
		if(amount>=50){
			int banknoteOf50=amount/50;
			Console.Write(" {0}x50",banknoteOf50)};
			amount=amount-(50*banknoteOf50);
		}
		if(amount>=20){
			int banknoteOf20=amount/20;
			Console.Write(" {0}x20",banknoteOf20)};
			amount=amount-(20*banknoteOf20);
		}
		if(amount>=10){
			int banknoteOf10=amount/10;
			Console.Write(" {0}x10",banknoteOf10)};
			amount=amount-(10*banknoteOf10);
		}
		if(amount>=5){
			int banknoteOf5=amount/5;
			Console.Write(" {0}x5",banknoteOf5)};
			amount=amount-(5*banknoteOf5);
		}
		if(amount>=1){
			int banknoteOf1=amount;
			Console.Write(" {0}x1",banknoteOf1)};
		}
	   }else{
	   	Console.WriteLine("A value of 0 was entered as the withdrawal amount.");	
		}
	}

	//if something is wrong, please just tell me and I will try again
